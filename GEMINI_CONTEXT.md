- Progress: Fixed login loop. Implemented doctor dashboard (menu, patient list) and medication management. Implemented patient view (prescriptions, BP). Provided Firestore rules and single-field index instructions. Currently debugging doctor data retrieval (suspected Firestore user document 'role' field issue).
- Project Progress:
- Login/Authentication: Fixed login loop; implemented email/password and Google Sign-In.
- User Roles: Implemented admin, doctor, and user roles; admins can assign roles.
- Dashboards:
    - Admin Dashboard (dashboard.html): Manages all users and roles.
    - Doctor Dashboard (doctor_dashboard.html): Menu linking to patient and medication management.
    - Patient List (patient_list.html): Displays and links to individual patient edit pages for doctors.
    - Patient Edit (patient_edit.html): Allows doctors to add blood pressure readings and prescriptions with reminders.
    - Medication Management (medication_management.html): Allows doctors to manage medications.
    - Patient Dashboard (main.html): Displays patient's prescriptions (with reminders) and blood pressure history.
- Firestore Rules & Indexing: Provided updated firestore.rules and instructions for deploying them, including details for single-field index on 'role'.
- Current Pending Issue: Doctor data not retrieved. Likely cause: incorrect or missing 'role: "doctor"' field in the doctor's user document in Firestore. Instructions to verify and fix this have been provided.
- Progress: Patient dashboard refactored into separate pages (My Prescriptions, Blood Pressure History, Edupharma, Healthy Dashboard, Medication Interaction). Patient editing for doctors now uses a modal with multi-add prescriptions and clear history features. Debugged several JavaScript and Firestore rule issues.
